# wafflehacks

Created for WaffleHacks2022, a virtual hackathon with students from all across the world.

Working with Jonathan from South Africa and Carly from Hong Kong, we created a project that would tackle the issue of food insecurites among college students.
The framework was created with Flask and most of the frontend was done with HTML/CSS with a sprinkle of JS. 
Using MySQL, we are able to save the restaurant and the students' datas into a database and use it to connect both of them to a local food bank.
Using twilio, students who would sign up using their phone number and email would get notifications on local food banks or food drives sponsored by any restaurants.
